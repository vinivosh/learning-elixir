# Learning Elixir

Just a simple repository with exercises I did in a journey to master the Elixir programming language

# Joy of Elixir

This section contains all exercises I did when reading the [Joy of Elixir](https://joyofelixir.com/) book.

It's a book for **absolute beginners**, but I still decided to start by reading it out of curiosity. Never had seen someone attempt to teach a functional programming language such as Elixir to a total beginner.
