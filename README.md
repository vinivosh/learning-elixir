# Learning Elixir

Just a simple repository with exercises and projects I did in a journey to master the Elixir programming language



# The Complete Elixir and Phoenix Bootcamp

This section contains all project exercises I did for [The Complete Elixir and Phoenix Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial) Udemy course, by [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/stephengrider).

The main "attraction" is the **Discuss** project, which is a webforum-like application for discussing topics by posting comments.

Features include:
- Storing data in a Postgres DB using Ecto;
- OAuth authentication for logging in with GitHub with Ãœberauth;
- Live loading of comments, using websockets.

# Joy of Elixir

This section contains all exercises I did when reading the [Joy of Elixir](https://joyofelixir.com/) book.

It's a book for **absolute beginners**, but I still decided to start by reading it out of curiosity. Never had seen someone attempt to teach a functional programming language such as Elixir to a total beginner.
